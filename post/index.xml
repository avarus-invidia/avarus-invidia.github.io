      <description>So you&amp;rsquo;re working just fine, no errors present in compilation, and then suddenly when you try it out it breaks on you due to memory related issues that make absolutely no sense.
Of course, I am not even using vector. It is, of course, an old library. However, what can you do? The main code is made to work with that library due to its, ah, how was it? The bytes are stored close to each other so that accessing them becomes quicker.</description>

      <description> The pizza today was great Overly stressed I indulged myself in a Mezzo/Mezzo pizza, one side being a quattro formaggi (four cheese) and the other one being bussola (ham and shrimp).
And now I&amp;rsquo;m contemplating nothing. Head empty, no thoughts.
