But not I! Of course! Never I. But why would I? I never google stuff like this because I never think of it existing. Now thanks to my supervisor I got a hand on Valgrind. All you have to do is install it via a repo by using:\nsudo apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo install valgrind for Linux (Debian based). In macOS it would be through MacPorts. However, at this time and on the new ARM64 macOS, it is impossible to do so. Even by resorting to the old method of compiling the program through the source code, it requires you have macOS 10.12 with Darwin 17.x at the latest. The problem is that said macOS version is High Sierra. Why is that a problem? The last release of High Sierra was on the 9th of July 2018! Almost 4 years and no update has been done on it since (for macOS).\nI know of the clang fsanitizer flag, but it\u0026rsquo;s not exactly as good as valgrind.\nSo how\u0026rsquo;s my work going? Well it\u0026rsquo;s going fine insofar. I just have issues with the big picture related to one of the solvers. It seems that it\u0026rsquo;s working properly, the issue is that it fails to pass the tolerance check after a set time period, which in itself is absurd. Why? Because I\u0026rsquo;ve tested it myself by switching the time step by one order of magnitude. Say after 10 iterations it breaks with the old time step. Now it breaks at 100 iterations after reducing the time step. So it\u0026rsquo;s something to do with the method.\n","date":"February 8, 2022","hero":"/images/default-hero.jpg","permalink":"https://avarus-invidia.github.io/posts/daily-thoughts/memory_leakage_debugger/","summary":"So you\u0026rsquo;re having issues with memory allocation in your code?

But numerically speaking, h is just a very small number (1e-42 may as well be considered 0, but it\u0026rsquo;s not actually 0).\nAnd this is where the difference between analytical and numerically really sparks up. Because we do not choose an exact solution, we are left with a numerical error produced from our choice of h, the so called spacing.\nThe tree and the car Consider some distance where you have a tree at point 0 and a car at point 1. We would normally resort to some unit of measurement like meters or feet in order to find out the distance between the two. But let us simply assume the distance is unity, 1. What do we do then? Well if we look at the above equation and apply the function on this imaginary line we have between a tree and a car, then x over there represents some point within this distance. Suppose this to be the case. What do we do now? Well the exact approach tells us that this spacing h should go to 0, this implies that the distance between (x+h) and (x) is 0. So what happens if we decide it to, you know, not be 0? What if the distance between a point (x) and the next point (x+h) has a value?\nThe above question is rather simple to answer. It means that we are taking a route that does not lead us to the exact solution. But the problem now becomes quite practical. Suppose we have the following: $$L=1,$$ $$x=x_i=x_0..x_{N},$$ $$h=\\frac{L}{N},$$ $$x+h=x_i+h=x_{i+1},$$ $$i\\in [0..N].$$ First we have (L), which is the physical distance between the tree (0) and the car (N). The next one, (x), represents the points (i) on the line separating the tree and the car which have been sliced into (N-1) equal pieces. Then we have the point next to (x), (x+h). And the actual distance between two points is h. Think of it like being on point (x) and by taking a step you will land on (x+h).\nNow that I have put this out there, we can go forward. In practice, the derivative from above is written as: $$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{f_{i+1}-f_{i}{h}.$$\nThis is called the forward finite difference method.\nBut of course, the method doesn\u0026rsquo;t come out just like that. The situation is a bit more complicated. Suppose you have the function f(x+h). Then what can you do with it? You can Taylor exand it. But I won\u0026rsquo;t go into those details here (it\u0026rsquo;s midnight, leave me alone), suffice to say that Taylor exanding a function brings out its derivatives and from there you manipulate the equation such that you have the derivative on one side and the rest on the other. But from these Taylor expansions we can define the following finite difference methods:\nFirst-order forward finite difference (FFD) $$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{f_{i+1}-f_{i}}{h}.$$\nFirst-order backward finite difference (BFD) $$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{f_{i}-f_{i-1}}{h}.$$\nFird-order central finite difference (CFD) $$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{f_{i+1}-f_{i-1}}{2h}.$$\nSecond-order central finite difference $$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{f_{i+1}-2 f_i+f_{i-1}}{h^2}.$$\nSo we went from some complicated stuff like calculus to simply adding and subtracting some values. Simple, right? Well yes and no. For one, ghost cells! You see, we need points from the left and/or right of the domain. I initially said that the tree was point (0) and the car was point (N). But if we evaluate it at (N) we need point (N+1). Similarly for (0) we need point (-1). And that is why we have these things called ghost cells. They are simply an extension of the array through the minimum and maximum. It all depends on the required number of points a numerical scheme needs. Generally ghost cells would be either set to 0 or an extrapolation of the boundary conditions. Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s some interpollation. Boundary conditions are a scientific field themselves.\nOne of the major issues once can have when implementing numerical methods (though they also appear when solving problems analytically), and that is: boundary conditions! Boundary conditions define how the solution behaves at the boundary points. But boundary conditions are a talk for another time.\n","date":"February 1, 2022","hero":"/images/default-hero.jpg","permalink":"https://avarus-invidia.github.io/posts/numerical-methods/from-calculus-to-numbers/","summary":"We start off from the definition of a derivative: $$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\lim_{h\\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$$, where we have a limit of a function f(x) which depends on the variable x.

Say, we have a system (a region of space) which is populated by some particles (generally simple, point like particles). These particles have some initial state that we observed and we wish to know how the system evolves in time. Since the system is comprised of these particles, the evolution over time of the particle distribution should give us good insight on what will happen later on.\nWe have defined our system, but not our problem. We can either resort to the Boltzmann equation for colliding particles:$$\\frac{d u}{dt}=\\frac{\\partial t}{\\partial t}\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}+\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}{\\partial t}\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}+\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{p}}{\\partial t}\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\mathbf{p}}=\\frac{\\partial t}{\\partial t}\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}+\\frac{\\mathbf{p}}{m}\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}+\\mathbf{F}\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\mathbf{p}}=J$$ which enables us to insert detailed physical phenomena into the system based on some collision model J. Or resort to the more popular version of the Boltzmann equation which lacks collisions, J=0, called the Vlasov equation.\nThe heat equation For the purpose of this range of posts such equations can become increasingly complicated. Instead, I will take the simplest approach by resorting on the heat equation: $$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = k \\nabla^2 u,$$ where u is some state variable like particle density or temperature. The k denotes the diffusion coefficient which can be either constant or modelled after some physical phenomena to better represent what is happening in real life. It really depends on what you want to obtain. I will take the diffusion as being constant and equal to unity. And I will take into consideration a two-dimensiona (2D) system, such that: $$\\nabla^2=\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}+\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2}.$$ We will then use this homogeneous partial differential equation, called the heat equation, to exemplify the numerical approach to a problem. Of course, this equation does have an analytical solution: $$u(t,x,y) = \\sum_{m,n} A_{mn} sin(m \\pi x) sin(n \\pi y) e^{-\\pi^2(m^2+n^2)t},$$ with: $$A_mn = 4 \\int\\int dx dy \\quad u(0,x,y) sin(m \\pi x)sin(n \\pi y),$$ with initial condition (IC) u(0,x,y).\nNumerical? What does 1 and 2 have to do with anything? What I talked about above is the result obtained from approaching the problem analytically. There are plenty equations out there that describe a problem with real life application that have no analytical solution (not for a lack of trying). And for these we resort to numerical methods.\nSee the Euler method to find out how the problem is handled numerically.\nBut what is the problem exactly? Why can\u0026rsquo;t we find analytical solutions? The reason is calculus. It is an amazing tool that helps us understand countless physical phenomena, however it has its drawbacks in equation manipulation (or rather solving). We are unable to solve problems analytically because the mathematical language present to us is incomplete. So all we can do is wait. Or can we? If calculus is a problem for us, how do machines handle it? The answer to this is quite immediate. They don\u0026rsquo;t handle it. We handle it, so to speak. We convert calculus into something that a machine knows what to do, and that is addition and subtraction.\nSee how we go from calculus to simple operations.\n","date":"February 1, 2022","hero":"/images/default-hero.jpg","permalink":"https://avarus-invidia.github.io/posts/numerical-methods/where-to-begin/","summary":"So you have a problem\u0026hellip; So we have a problem that we wish to analyse.
